PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Gravity Wells is an original game that is based on the physics of gravitational interaction. The objective of this game is to get a 'player' planet into a portal while avoiding gravity wells and other orbiting planet obstacles.

HOW TO RUN
The file 'gravityWellsMainCode.py' contains the code for the program. cmu_112_graphics is the only dependency - it and the required image files are stored in the codeDirectory where the program file is located.

HOW TO PLAY
- Select a level - difficulty increases with each one.

- The orange planet is the 'player'. It can be controlled by clicking on it and dragging, then releasing, like a slingshot. The white line shows the initial launch direction, and is proportional to the launch force that will be applied on the planet.
	- The planet can still be directed while it is in motion - this does require some dexterity and predicting where the planet will be due to gravitational motion, though, so be quick, and try to plan the initial trajectory as best as you can!

- The white circles are the gravity wells. These will exert a gravitational force on the planet, and must be avoided.

- The blue planets orbiting the gravity wells are also obstacles that must be avoided - these will also exert a gravitational force on the player, but it is minimal due to their size.

- The planet can bounce off walls.

- Aim to get the planet to the blue rectangular portal.

- You have 10 lives to attempt to complete a level.
